                    <h1>About Me:</h1>
                    <h3>Hi, I'm Rajia Rani — a passionate Educator turned Full-Stack Web Developer.</h3>
                    <p>
                        With a rich academic background and over <strong>4 years </strong>of experience as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry, I’ve guided and mentored countless students across Chemistry (Grades 10–12) and Mathematics (Grades 6–10). My journey in teaching not only honed my ability to explain complex topics clearly but also cultivated a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and a growth mindset.
                    </p>

                    <h1>My Career Shift into Tech:</h1>
                    <p>Driven by a deep love for learning and curiosity about how the digital world works, I made the bold decision to transition into Full Stack Web Development. Over the last year, I’ve been fully immersed in mastering technologies such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>🌐 Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap</li>
                        <li><strong>🛠️ Backend:</strong> Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs</li>
                        <li><strong>🧠 Databases:</strong> MongoDB, SQL</li>
                        <li><strong>💡 Tools & Concepts:</strong> Git, GitHub, EJS, npm, DOM manipulation, C++, Java, Python</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        My teaching experience gave me a strong command of Linear Algebra, Calculus, and logic-based problem-solving — skills that translate seamlessly into writing efficient, clean, and scalable code.
                    </p>
                    <h1>What I Love Building:</h1>
                    <p>I’m passionate about creating user-centric, responsive web applications that solve real-world problems. Whether it’s a learning management system, personal portfolio, or data-driven dashboard — I enjoy seeing ideas come to life through code.</p>
                    <h1>My Mission</h1>
                    <p>To bridge the gap between education and technology by building impactful solutions and continuously growing as a software developer. I believe in blending my teaching background with technical knowledge to make a difference in the digital world.</p>
