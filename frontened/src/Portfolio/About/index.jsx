                            👋 Hi, I’m Rajia Rani - a passionate educator turned Full-Stack Developer and Co-Founder of a deep-tech startup. <br />

                            My journey began with a BSc in Non-Medical Sciences, where I developed a strong interest in Quantum Mechanics, Mathematics, and Computational Thinking. Later, I earned an MSc in Chemistry, further sharpening my analytical skills and scientific mindset.

                            For over 4 years, I worked as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry, and for 5+ years, I tutored high school students in Chemistry (Grades 10–12) and Mathematics (Grades 6–10). Teaching not only deepened my love for learning but also honed my skills in communication, problem-solving, and mentoring.

                            In 2023, I began a focused transition into Computer Science & Web Development. Since then, I’ve mastered core technologies including: <br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>🖥️ Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS</li>
                                <li> ⚙️ Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Flask</li>
                                <li>🗄️ Databases: MongoDB, MySQL</li>
                                <li>🔍 Concepts: DSA, OOPs, REST APIs, MVC Architecture</li>
                            </ul>
                            🚀 Startup Journey
                            In January 2025, I co-founded MAJORANA AI LABS PRIVATE LIMITED with my husband. Our vision is to develop cutting-edge solutions at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing.

                            🌐 Featured Project: Abroadhub.in
                            A full-stack web platform built for an educational service company, integrating user registration, dashboards, content management, and more - aligned with real-world business needs.

                            🧠 With a strong foundation in Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Quantum Science, I’m now preparing to pursue an MSc in Quantum Computing in the U.S. to align academically with our startup’s mission.
