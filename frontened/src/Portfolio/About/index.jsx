              Hi, I'm Rajia Rani 👩‍🔬👩‍💻- 
              <br/> a passionate educator turned Full-Stack
              Developer and Co-Founder of a deep-tech startup.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ex-Assistant Professor | Full-Stack Web Developer | Co-founder of
              MAJORANA AI LABS <br />
              With 4+ years in academia and 1+ year in tech, I bridge the gap
              between science and software. Currently building AI + Quantum
              Computing solutions, exploring deep tech, and coding full-stack
              applications. <br />
              📍 Based in USA | 🎯 Focused on Web, AI, and Quantum Tech
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey began with a BSc in Non-Medical Sciences, where I
              developed a strong interest in Quantum Mechanics, Mathematics, and
              Computational Thinking. Later, I earned an MSc in Chemistry,
              further sharpening my analytical skills and scientific mindset.
              For over 4 years, I worked as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry,
              and for 5+ years, I tutored high school students in Chemistry
              (Grades 10–12) and Mathematics (Grades 6–10). Teaching not only
              deepened my love for learning but also honed my skills in
              communication, problem-solving, and mentoring.
